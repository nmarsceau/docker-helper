# Docker-Helper

A collection of helper functions for working with Docker, written in PowerShell.

## Archived

I don't use this project anymore, so I have archived it. If you still find it useful, feel free to keep using it or even fork it, if you'd like!

In retrospect, most of the helper functions I wrote for this weren't really necessary at all. I was mainly just having fun writing PowerShell stuff. :) For instance, the shortcuts for building images could have been replaced with more comprehensive use of docker-compose itself.

This Gist has a paired-down list of [the actual shortcuts I still use on a day-to-day basis](https://gist.github.com/nmarsceau/fb89ef02d1b318f672eb731d7fd143f5).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your PowerShell modules directory.

   The path to Docker-Helper.psm1 should be:
   ```
   C:\Users\your username\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\Docker-Helper\Docker-Helper.psm1
   ```

2. Run `d-help` for usage information. The module will be automatically imported the first time you use it.
